This mod was originally created by kaeza and RAPHAEL, but I decided to enhance it.

What does it do? It allows anyone with the "jail" priv to send players to jail and release them from jail. Every 30 seconds it sends prisoners back to jail (in case they escape). You can edit the init.lua file to change how often it sends the prisoners to jail and also the jail coordinates. This mod also adds barbed wire. It will revoke all of the players privs when they are sent to jail, and will restore them on his release. This mod also allows anyone with the "freeze" priv to immobilize player or remobilize players.

To send someone to jail, do:
/jail playername

To release someone from jail do:
/release playername

To freeze someone (Make it so that they can't move) do:
/freeze playername

To defrost someone (Make it so that can move again) do:
/defrost playername

To grant someone the priv to send someone to jail and release them do:
/grant playername jail

To get jail barbed wire, use /giveme jail:barbedwire, or get it from the creative inventory.

You MUST build a jail before you can send someone to jail! (this shouldn't have to be mentioned but mentioning it anyway).

No screenshots are offered since theres nothing really to screenshot.

Feel free to offer better textures and any ideas. Also report any issues.
